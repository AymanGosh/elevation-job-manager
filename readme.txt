 Elevation Job_Manager Platform,
 a platform for Elevation's management team that helps them keep track of their studentsâ€™ job applications 
 and gives them real-time updates on their statuses of where they are in their path to find a job.
 The platform was built using #MERN stack (React, MobX) with MongoDB Database, 
 along with implementing JEST testing and other libraries such as JWT, Nodemailer, Twilio, and more.
